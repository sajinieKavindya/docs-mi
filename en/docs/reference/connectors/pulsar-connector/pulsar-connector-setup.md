# Set up Apache Pulsar

In this section, weâ€™ll walk through how to set up an Apache Pulsar standalone server for local testing and development. This setup will also demonstrate how to enable **TLS encryption** and **JWT-based authentication**, which are essential for establishing secure and authenticated communication with the Pulsar broker.

### Download and Extract Pulsar

- Download the Apache Pulsar v4.0.4 release from the [official website](https://pulsar.apache.org/download/). (This example was tested with Apache Pulsar version 4.0.4.)
- Extract the archive to a preferred location on your machine.

### Configure TLS Encryption

For this example, **TLS encryption using PEM certificates** is used to ensure secure communication with the Pulsar broker. To configure TLS with PEM, refer to the official [Apache Pulsar documentation](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/next/security-tls-transport/#configure-mtls-encryption-with-pem) for a step-by-step guide and ensure that you have the following components prepared:

- A **Certificate Authority (CA)** certificate (`ca.cert.pem`) - `tlsTrustCertsFilePath`
- A **server certificate** (`server.cert.pem`) - `tlsCertificateFilePath`
- The **server's private key** (`server.key-pk8.pem`) - `tlsKeyFilePath`

### Configure Authentication using tokens based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

For this example, **JWT-based authentication** is used to restrict access to authorized clients only. To configure JWT authentication, refer to the official [Apache Pulsar documentation](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/next/security-jwt/) for a step-by-step guide. Ensure that you have the following components prepared:

- A **JWT token** that includes the necessary claims for authentication. The compact representation of a signed JWT is a string that looks like:
    ```bash
    eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJKb2UifQ.ipevRNuRP6HflG8cFKnmUPtypruRC4fb1DWtoLL62SY
    ```

  Once the JWT token is generated, configure the Pulsar broker to enable JWT-based authentication.

### Start the Pulsar Standalone Server

- Navigate to the extracted Pulsar directory.
- Start the standalone server using the following command:

      ```bash
      bin/pulsar standalone
      ```

!!!Note
    - For setting up Pulsar in other environments such as Docker or Kubernetes, please refer to the [official Apache Pulsar documentation](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/next/getting-started-home/).
    - The recommended version of Java for Apache Pulsar is 21 or above.
